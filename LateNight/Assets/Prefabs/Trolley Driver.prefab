  npcDialogue:
  - You notice the trolley driver paying attention to the road, but then she turns
    to look at you.
  - I find it funny that you ask me of all people that, so many interesting people
    around and yet you only chose to talk to me.
  - Initially I hated it, I had to completely change how I lived my life. But thankfully
    some of the people that I meet make it all worthwhile.
  - "The road keeps going, there\u2019s always tomorrow. Keep your foot on the gas
    but don\u2019t be afraid to break."
  - Well I can tell that you have had a long day, I hope you enjoy the rest of the
    ride.

  playerResponses:
  - How has your day been?
  - How's the night shift?
  - "I\u2019ve been having a pretty rough time lately. Any worldly advice for me?"
  - '*Choose to say nothing*'
