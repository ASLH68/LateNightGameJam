  npcDialogue:
  - You notice a pot held rabbit smoking a large pipe and wearing a beret.
  - I'm rather partial to a well-buttered loaf of brioche but recently I find myself
    entranced by the cavalcade of flavors present in naan.
  - Well we all know that tomato soup will always be the best. But my personal favorite
    with my esteemed palette has to be steamed carrots.
  - This is only the start of my journey! As you can tell, my greatness has not been
    recognized.
  - Ugh they are so unrefined with their pile of tidbits instead of the elaborately
    placed delicacies that compose the disposition that is a sandwich.

  playerResponses:
  - What is your favorite type of bread?
  - What is the best pairing with a good ol' grilled cheese?
  - "You don\u2019t sound like you should be in fast food, why are you?"
  - "I\u2019m more of a taco guy myself."

  - "I don\u2019t know what I have to be recognized."
  - "It\u2019s difficult to continue onward when you don\u2019t know where you are
    looking."
  - I think I will stick to PB&Js, thank you very much.
  - Tacos can be just as much of a delicacy as any highfalutin sandwich.
